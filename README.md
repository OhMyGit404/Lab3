Exercise 2: Inputs & If-Statements (Ungraded) – 1 hour

Instructions: -Attempt all the following. Create files as necessary

-Be sure to print suitable headings and or labels for the values to be output
- Attempt the following in Pairs, but have your own code

Follow the instructions carefully to the end.
1. Write Code to generate a pattern similar to the one given using ONE cout function ONLY.

Use Asterix (*) instead of x
2. Write a program that lets the user enter two integers. The program should then
find the maximum of the two numbers and output the same to the user. NB: If the
numbers are equal, the program should output that the two are equal.
3. A store uses the following policy to award discount. If the customer purchases
products costing more than Ksh 30,000 she is given a discount of 10%, otherwise
she is given a discount of 2%. Write a complete C++ program that allows a user to
input the total value of purchases then the program computes and outputs the
discount a customer will receive.

4. Write a program which reads an integer from the user and decides whether that
integer is even or odd. (Use appropriate output statements).
5. Write a program that contains an if-else statement that prints a message that
indicates whether a real number (double) entered by a user is positive or negative.

6. Employees’ gross salaries are taxed depending on the tax bracket as depicted
below:
Basic Salary Tax Percentage
<=10000 0%
<=30000 5%
<=50000 10%
<=70000 13%
>70000 15%
Write a program that enables the user to input their gross salary, computes the tax
and outputs the net salary (after tax deduction) to the user.
7. Write a program to input electricity unit charges and calculate total electricity bill
according to the given conditions:
• For first 50 units Ksh. 0.50/unit
• For next 100 units Ksh. 0.75/unit
• For next 100 units Ksh. 1.20/unit
• For unit above 250 Ksh. 1.50/unit
An additional surcharge of 20% is added to the bill
